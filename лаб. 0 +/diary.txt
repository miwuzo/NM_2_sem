help
--- help for <strong>end</strong> ---

 <strong>end</strong> Terminate scope of FOR, WHILE, SWITCH, TRY, and IF statements.
    Without <strong>end</strong>'s, FOR, WHILE, SWITCH, TRY, and IF wait for further input.
    Each <strong>end</strong> is paired with the closest previous unpaired FOR, WHILE,
    SWITCH, TRY or IF and serves to terminate its scope.
 
    <strong>end</strong> also marks the termination of a function, although in
    most cases it is optional. <strong>end</strong> statements are required only in 
    MATLAB files that employ one or more nested functions. Within such a
    file, every function (including primary, nested, private, and 
    subfunctions) must be terminated with an <strong>end</strong> statement. You can 
    terminate any function type with <strong>end</strong>, but doing so is not required
    unless the file contains a nested function.
 
    <strong>end</strong> can also serve as the last index in an indexing expression.  In
    that context, <strong>end</strong> = SIZE(X,k) when used as part of the k-th index.
    Examples of this use are, X(3:end) and X(1,1:2:end-1).  When using <strong>end</strong>
    to grow an array, as in X(end+1) = 5, make sure X exists first.
 
    <strong>end</strong>(A,K,N) is called for indexing expressions involving the object A
    when <strong>end</strong> is part of the K-th index out of N indices.  For example,
    the expression A(end-1,:) calls A's <strong>end</strong> method with <strong>end</strong>(A,1,2).
